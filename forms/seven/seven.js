/*
Write a program to calculate debt-to-income ratio using a function 
and controls (no prompt, alert, console.log, etc).
Use these controls: Bootstrap4 button(s), label(s), input(s), 
and one control of your choice. 
** before you start, set the height property for this form
to 600. That will give you more space that would scroll on a phone. 

Get these from the user; we will assume the user has 
only 3 debts:  
> monthly car payment
> monthly rent payment
> monthly credit card payment

Also get the users' gross monthly income.

Create a function that takes four parameters (the 3 debts and the 
gross monthly income) and returns the debt-to-income ratio to the 
main program.
Use this formula:
   (sum of the monthly debt payments/gross monthly income ) x 100
Display the answer from the main program 
(not from the function) 
using a control. 

Example:
Say you have these numbers from the user:
      Car payment: $150/month
      Rent payment: $550/month
      Credit Card Payment: $250/month
      Gross Income: $2500/month
In this case the debt to income ratio would be 38%
